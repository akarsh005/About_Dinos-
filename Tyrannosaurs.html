	<h2>"King of the Tyrant Lizards"</h2>
	<h4 class="c2">
	<h3> "Strengths"</h3>
	<h4 class="c3">Tyrannosaurus rex, whose name means “king of the tyrant lizards,” was built to rule.
	This dinosaur’s muscular body stretched as long as 40 feet—about the size of a school bus—from
	its snout to the tip of its powerful tail. Weighing up to eight tons, T. rex stomped headfirst across
	its territory on two strong legs. These dinosaurs likely preyed on living animals and scavenged
	carcasses—and sometimes they even ate one another.</h4><br />
	<h3>"Weaknesses"</h3>
	<h4 class="c4">
	Not everything about Tyrannosaurus rex was fierce, however. This dinosaur had unexpectedly puny arms,
	and the function of these little limbs is a source of debate among scientists. Some believe the animal’s 
	arms were an evolutionary leftover—like the pelvic bones of a snake—or served non-predatory purposes like
	helping it grip a mate. Others argue that T. rex’s arms may have been adapted for “vicious slashing” at close 
	quarters, given their ability to inflict deep wounds with four-inch claws.And while they had strong thighs, these 
	dinosaurs were not speedy. They could only walk briskly at up to 12 miles an hour—likely not fast enough to chase a 
	speeding Jeep, as depicted in the movie Jurassic Park. Using biomechanical models, scientists have theorized that if these
	heavy animals moved any faster, they would have shattered the bones in their feet.
	</h4>
	<h3>"Extinction"</h3>
	<h4 class="c5">
	Tyrannosaurus rex had a life expectancy of about 28 years. Previous studies have suggested that it went through a
	growth spurt in its teenage years, but until recently, scientists didn’t know much about how it grew from a hatchling
	to a powerful predator.<br />
	In spite of all its advantages, T. rex was no match for the mass extinction event that claimed three quarters 
	of life on Earth 66 million years ago. This cataclysm occurred when an asteroid or comet the size of a mountain
	slammed into Earth, wiping out Tyrannosaurus rex along with the rest of the non-avian dinosaurs and bringing a 
	sudden end to the Cretaceous period.
