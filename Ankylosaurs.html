	<h2>"Ankylosaurs"</h2>
	<h4 class="c2">
	Ankylosaurus, (genus Ankylosaurus), armoured ornithischian dinosaurs that lived 70 million to 66 million
	years ago in North America during the Late Cretaceous Period. Ankylosaurus is a genus belonging to a
	larger group (infraorder Ankylosauria) of related four-legged heavily armoured herbivorous dinosaurs 
	that flourished throughout the Cretaceous Period (145.5 million to 66 million years ago).
	<br />
	Ankylosaurus was one of the largest ankylosaurs, with a total length of about 10 metres (33 feet) 
	and a probable weight of about four tons. Its head was square and flat and was broader than it was long.
	Its teeth, like those of the related stegosaurs, consisted of a simple curved row of irregularly edged 
	(crenulated) leaf-shaped teeth. The body was short and squat, with massive legs to support its weight. Like other ankylosaurs,
	its back and flanks were protected from attack by thick bands of armour consisting of flat bony plates.
	These plates were supplemented by rows of bony spikes projecting from the animal’s flanks and by bony knobs on its back. 
	The skull was also heavily armoured and spiked. Ankylosaurus’s long tail terminated in a thick “club” of bone,
	which it probably swung as a defense against predators. This club was formed by the last tail vertebrae, which were nested
	tightly against each other and a sheath of several bony plates. The armour schemes of other ankylosaurs varied somewhat,
	but all were well protected against attack by carnivorous dinosaurs. The earliest ankylosaurs, called nodosaurs, 
	lacked the tail club and had rather different armour patterns.
