INTRODUCTION
Hello Aliens, Welcome to the “World of Dinosaurs”.
It’s a place where you develop a basic knowledge about the species that faced “Extinction”.

HOW I GOT THE IDEA FOR DEVELOPMENT?
I was busy with my Web Development courses but as I finished that, I got an interest to develop a Web Page so I started… I started coding. At that time I didn’t had any idea about the topics on which I’ll make the page.

HOW I GOT THE IDEA ABOUT THE TOPIC?
It was just a simple and usual afternoon, I just had my lunch and sat with my mobile phone and started scrolling feeds and that’s when I came to this one picture of Tyrannosaurs commonly known as T-Rex. So yeah, guess what, I just combined my interest of coding and developing Web Page and my enthusiasm for getting knowledge about dinosaurs.
CONCLUSION
Just keep exploring things and you might come to something that will create an impact on you and yeah don’t forget to ignore the disappointing messages that you’ll get while building your project but don’t forget to appreciate the ones who really suggest you with some ideas about your project. Appreciate “The Critics” and ignore “The Demotivators” and keep banging on.
