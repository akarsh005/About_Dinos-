	<h2>"Triceratops"</h2>
	<h4 class="c2">
	 Velociraptor sickle-clawed dinosaur that flourished in central and eastern Asia during the
	 Late Cretaceous Period (99 million to 65 million years ago). It is closely 
	 related to the North American Deinonychus of the Early Cretaceous in that both
	 reptiles were dromaeosaurs. Both possessed an unusually large claw on each foot,
	 as well as ossified tendon reinforcements in the tail that enabled them to
	 maintain balance while striking and slashing at prey with one foot upraised.
	 Velociraptor was smaller than Deinonychus, reaching a length of only 1.8 metres
	 (6 feet) and perhaps weighing no more than 45 kg (100 pounds). Velociraptor
	 appears to have been a swift, agile predator of small herbivores.
	<br />
	There’s strong consensus among scientists that today’s birds are actually dinosaurs,
	and that they evolved from theropods, a family of three-toed predators that included 
	Velociraptor mongoliensis and Tyrannosaurus rex. This family connection explains why 
	Velociraptors had many traits found in modern-day birds, including their hinged ankles, 
	swivel-jointed wrists, wishbones, and forward-facing toes. Most notable, though, was their plumage.
	Researchers have long suspected that Velociraptors were feathered rather than covered with reptilian scales. 
	In 2007, a study published in the journal Science found that a Velociraptor mongoliensis fossil had quill 
	knobs—bumps along its forearm that anchor feather quills to the bone and are common in modern birds.
