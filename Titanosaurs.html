	<h2>"Titanosaurs"</h2>
	<h4 class="c2">
	Titanosaur, (clade Titanosauria), diverse group of sauropod dinosaurs classified in the clade Titanosauria,
	which lived from the Late Jurassic Epoch (163.5 million to 145 million years ago) to the end of the Cretaceous
	Period (145 million to 66 million years ago). Titanosaur fossils have been found on all continents except
	Antarctica and include some 40 species. The group contains the largest terrestrial animals known, some 
	even approaching the size of modern whales.
	<br />
	Like other sauropods, titanosaurs were herbivorous quadrupeds with long tails, long necks, and small heads.
	They differed from other sauropods, however, in that the titanosaursâ€™ bodies were stockier and their limbs
	produced a wider stance than other sauropods. Titanosaurs also possessed vertebrae with a honeycomb-like 
	internal structure and six sacral vertebrae (vertebrae adjacent to the pelvis), but they lacked the 
	hyposphene-hypantrum joints (which connected one vertebra to another) in their dorsal vertebrae (vertebrae that 
	articulate with the ribs). In addition, some titanosaurs, such as Rapetosaurus and Saltasaurus, have been shown to
	have possessed osteoderms (armoured plates).+<br/>
	Lately, titanosaurs (but not Titanosaurus) have been generating headlines, as bigger and bigger specimens have been 
	discovered in South America. The largest dinosaur yet known is a South American titanosaur, Argentinosaurus, 
	but the recent announcement of the evocatively named Dreadnoughtus may imperil its place in the record books.
	There are also a few as-yet-unidentified titanosaur specimens that may have been even bigger, but we can only know 
	for sure pending further study by experts.
