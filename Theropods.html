	<h2>"Theropoda"</h2>
	<h4 class="c2">
	Theropod, any member of the dinosaur subgroup Theropoda, which includes all the flesh-eating
	dinosaurs. Theropods were the most diverse group of saurischian (“lizard-hipped”) dinosaurs, 
	ranging from the crow-sized Microraptor to the huge Tyrannosaurus rex, which weighed
	six tons or more.
	<br />
	The theropod (meaning "beast-footed") dinosaurs are a diverse group of bipedal saurischian dinosaurs.
	They include the largest terrestrial carnivores ever to have made the earth tremble. What most people
	think of as theropods (e.g., T. rex, Deinonychus) are extinct today, but recent studies have conclusively shown 
	that birds are actually the descendants of small nonflying theropods. Thus when people say that dinosaurs are extinct,
	they are technically not correct. Still it's not as exciting seeing a sparrow at your birdfeeder as it would be to see
	a Tyrannosaurus rex there.
