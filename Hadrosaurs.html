	<h2>"Hadrosaurs"</h2>
	<h4 class="c2">
	Hadrosaurids or duck-billed dinosaurs, are members of the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae.
	This group is known as the duck-billed dinosaurs for the flat duck-bill appearance of the bones in 
	their snouts. The family, which includes ornithopods such as Edmontosaurus and Parasaurolophus,
	was a common group of herbivores during the Late Cretaceous Period in what is now Asia, Europe,
	Africa, Antarctica, South America, and North America.Hadrosaurids are descendants of the
	Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous iguanodontian dinosaurs and had a similar body layout.
	<br />
	Like other ornithischians, hadrosaurids had a predentary bone and a pubic bone which was positioned
	backwards in the pelvis. Hadrosauridae is divided into two principal subfamilies: the lambeosaurines
	(Lambeosaurinae), which had hollow cranial crests or tubes; and the saurolophines (Saurolophinae), 
	identified as hadrosaurines (Hadrosaurinae) in most pre-2010 works, which lacked hollow cranial crests 
	(solid crests were present in some forms). Saurolophines tended to be bulkier than lambeosaurines.
	Lambeosaurines included the aralosaurins, tsintaosaurins, lambeosaurins and parasaurolophins, 
	while saurolophines included the brachylophosaurins, kritosaurins, saurolophins and edmontosaurins.
	Hadrosaurids were facultative bipeds, with the young of some species walking mostly on two legs and 
	the adults walking mostly on four.Their jaws were evolved for grinding plants,
	with multiple rows of teeth replacing each other as the teeth wore down.
