	<h2>"Apatosaurus"</h2>
	<h4 class="c2">
	Sauropod, any member of the dinosaur subgroup Sauropoda, marked by large size,
	a long neck and tail, a four-legged stance, and a herbivorous diet. These reptiles
	were the largest of all dinosaurs and the largest land animals that ever lived.
	<br />
	Sauropods shared a body plan consisting of: a small head on an extremely long neck;
	a long, massive body housing an enormous gut; thick pillarlike legs to support the torso;
	and a very long, tapering, often whiplike tail. A massive hip girdle was fused to the backbone,
	usually by five sacral vertebrae; this arrangement provided solid support for the body and tail.
	The backbone itself was hollowed out at the sides, which thus reduced its weight while retaining
	structural strength. Sauropods were once thought to have spent their time wallowing in shallow
	water that would help support their ponderous bodies, but considerable evidence indicates that
	they were better equipped for living on solid ground. The animalsâ€™ long necks enabled them to take 
	foliage from even the tallest trees in somewhat the same manner as do modern giraffes. Their teeth
	tended to be spoon-shaped or pencil-shaped, and they apparently depended on swallowed stones or
	bacteria in the gut to help break down the plant matter they ate.
