	Triceratops is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur that first appeared during the
	late Maastrichtian stage of the late Cretaceous period, about 68 million years ago (mya) 
	in what is now North America.<br />

	<h2>"Triceratops"</h2>
	<h4 class="c2">
	Triceratops is the most commonly recovered dinosaur in the uppermost Cretaceous deposits of western 
	North America, and its remains have been found throughout the region. Although many other large ceratopsians 
	have been discovered in massive bone beds representing numerous individuals, Triceratops has only rarely been
	found in groups of three or more individuals. When the first specimen was discovered in 1887, it was
	mistaken for a gigantic species of extinct bison. Only later did further discoveries reveal that it was 
	actually a horned dinosaur. Triceratops was officially named and described by American paleontologist
	O.C. Marsh in 1889. At present there are two recognized species: T. horridus and T. prorsus.
	<br />
	The majority of Triceratops specimens are known from skulls or partial skulls, and bones from the rest of
	the body are less commonly recovered. From fossil remains of other parts of the body, paleontologists have
	been able to determine that the hind limbs of Triceratops were larger than the forelimbs, but both sets were 
	very stout. Whether the forelimbs were held fully erect, as in the modern rhinoceros, is debated, though there
	is some evidence to suggest that they were held in a semisprawling position (an intermediate stance between
	the erect position of a rhinoceros and the fully sprawling limbs of most lizards). The dinosaurâ€™s short toes
	probably terminated in small hooves. The tail, as in many other large horned dinosaurs, appears to have been 
	fairly short.
